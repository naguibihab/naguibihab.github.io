								<p>I have been a software developer for over six years, and during that time I have work for/with/along-side multiple startups, I got to experience the startup world time and time again, from getting an idea off a piece of paper and making it into a revenue-generating or time-saving application. I got to see many fail and fall and many get funded or make enough revenue to be reckongised in the market.</p>
								<p>I am passionate about ideas that solve core problems that a lot of people are facing day to day, innovative solutions that contribute to a better tomorrow, and software methods that unbalance and disrupt the way we use technology today.</p>

													<p>Nick and I started discussing him making the Android version for me back in January and from the very beginning I knew he knew his stuff and was someone I felt confident would represent my business in the best possible light. I think as small business owners when we engage another business to do something for us, them actually doing the job is only part of the overall experience- how they go about their work, their values and morals and how professional they are throughout the relationship is just as important, at least it is for me anyway. Nick ticked every single one of these boxes and it got to a stage where he was more annoyed at the thought of him missing deadlines than I was. I was continually kept updated and his attention to detail was incredible- he refused to proceed with something unless it was perfect. If you need a website or app built to an extremely high standard by an ultimate professional, then Nick is your man. Highly recommended- thanks again mate.</p>

													<p>I recently went to An Idea For An App on behalf of a client to get assistance in the web-development of an online invoicing system.
													The work they did for me was done quickly and with great care. What I found most notable about An Idea For An App was that it worked with my budget, I didn't feel overcharged and had plenty of tech support and communication throughout the project.
													I will definitely be using An Idea For An App in the future!</p>

He's not only a guru in web development but he sees things from a business perspective which is what you need from partners, suppliers, etc. He offered technical advice that would be suitable from a business sense but also looked out for us and gave us value. It's so refreshing to find honest and helpful people these days. Thanks again Nick Ihab!</p>
