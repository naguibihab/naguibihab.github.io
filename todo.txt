o Consulting:
	> What can I do for you
		> My speciality is in breaking down a big project into phases, milestones and tasks then estimate the cost of each phase and building a team with the needed skills.
		> I focus on one client at a time next to my full time job with a few exceptions, so I make sure I am fully dedicated to the project.
		> I don't charge a margin like most software companies instead, I charge for my own hours and each member of the team charges the client directly; by doing so it's clear where the money is being spent.
		> I follow an extreme agile methodology and require my client to be available throughout the whole project and involved in each meeting and minor decisions.
