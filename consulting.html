							I help companies in building their software application, their team, and their process. I make sure that the application's code quality is up to community standard and that the team is following the modern best practices introduced by leading software companies such as Google, Amazon and Atlassian and the frameworks used behind the scenes is in-line with the latest stable technology.

								<p>I don't charge a margin like most software companies; instead, I charge for my own hours and each member of the team charges the client directly; by doing so it's clear where the money is being spent.</p>

								<p>I'm so grateful to you, honestly for the help and advice you offered on our platform. He's not only a guru in web development but he sees things from a business perspective which is what you need from partners, suppliers, etc. He offered technical advice that would be suitable from a business sense but also looked out for us and gave us value. It's so refreshing to find honest and helpful people these days. Thanks again Nick Ihab!</p>

								<p>I think as small business owners when we engage another business to do something for us, them actually doing the job is only part of the overall experience - how they go about their work, their values and morals and how professional they are throughout the relationship is just as important. Nick ticked every single one of these boxes. I was continually kept updated and his attention to detail was incredible. If you need a website or app built to an extremely high standard by an ultimate professional, then Nick is your man. Highly recommended- thanks again mate.</p>
