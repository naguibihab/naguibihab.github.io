					<h5 class="mb-xs heading-primary"><b>About The App</b></h5>
					<p class="mt-none mb-xlg fz-18">Emovey is a survey builder platform that uses emoticons instead of the usual text answers, making the experience of taking a survey simple and fun.</p>

					<h5 class="mb-xs heading-primary"><b>The Story</b></h5>
					<p class="mt-none mb-xlg fz-18">I met Phil back in 2015 through a mutual friend, he had this amazing idea for a survey builder and immediately got me convinced that his app would have a great impact on helping businesses take more valuable feedback from their customers. <br> I'll admit that Emovey was one of my challenging projects as it has a unique interface when you view the survey from a mobile (Check screenshots), an interface that any web developer would know is extremely tricky, but we managed and with styling tricks we were able to make that happen and match Phil's expectations</p>

					<p class="mt-none mb-xlg fz-18">
						In 2017 Emovey was used by Roc Eyewear for their campaign, so if you have answered a Roc Eyewear Survey  customer, you may have used Emovey.

							<p>I approached Nick with an idea to develop a customer service survey builder and was lucky enough that he chose to help me realise its development. Nick is very open, and extremely easy to communicate with from the very beginning of the development journey. I would definitely recommend An Idea For An App to anyone looking to turn their idea into something real!</p>
