					<p class="mt-none mb-xlg fz-18">Like any other plumbing company, Priority Plus Plumbing has an inventory of tools that get lost between their staff members and every week someone has to call all the staff that are on the road to find out who has the Vega. Peter decided to build an app that would counter that, by having the staff use a mobile app that would act as a ledger. <br>The app allows the user to see their current inventory, move items from their inventory to other inventories, request access to certain inventories and approve other requests coming to them. With an <b> Admin backend </b> the administrator can easily track where are all the tools and the history of transactions through a log page, and the app even allows the admin to override certain requests and maintain their trucks, sites, offices, users and tools. <br> The app also helps the plumbers by reminding them to pickup an item when they leave it at the repair shop.</p>
