	<p>It’s commonly known that when Google does something then there’s no need to look for an alternative because nothing will beat what Google has.<br>
	That is not the case when it comes to cloud platforms, especially if you’re still learning and don’t really know what you’re doing. Here’s a small comparison sheet that I made while I was still scratching the surface of both platforms, this comparison focuses on the first look and doesn’t dive deep into each platform and is specifically made for those who are looking to start with either AWS or Google Cloud but are not sure which to pick:</p>
	<p>1. User interface<br>
	Google cloud is definitely the winner in that one. By implementing a simple and familiar interface, it makes everything looks easy. AWS on the other hand have a more professional but less friendly interface and it’ll take you sometime to get used to.</p>
	<p>2. Projects:<br>
	Google Cloud allows you to separate your resources in different “projects”, this would be really handy if you’re working on multiple apps at once. AWS doesn’t offer that feature, instead, you have every resource in a single region mixed together. This one goes to Google cloud.</p>
	<p>3. Support:<br>
	At the time I’m writing this, AWS decent (chat and phone) support would cost at least $100 per month, and if you’re a beginner trust me you WILL need support. Google cloud’s support on the other hand would cost $400 if you want someone on the phone assisting you.</p>
	<p>4. AMIs Or in other words “Server templates”:<br>
	AWS offers an abundance of templates, market place and community. Google Cloud offers market place templates only, so if you want a LAMP template you’d have to get the one bitnami offers to Google Cloud users.</p>
	<p>5. Emailing service:<br>
	Google Cloud doesn’t offer an emailing service or smtp servers that you can use in your app, instead they are affiliated with different providers, SendGrid, Mailgun or Mailjet, who would provide you with smtp servers, and who of course have a limit on the amount of emails you can send out on a free package, which is around 25,000 emails per month. Or if you have a google apps account, you can use an email you have setup there as an SMTP server.<br>
	AWS on the other hand, has its own SES which offers 63,000 free emails every month then charges $0.1 per 10,000 emails.</p>
	<p>6. Instance cost:<br>
	Putting support aside and focusing on the cost of resources. In that point Google Cloud is the winner, they charge by 10 minute increments while AWS charges by the hour for on demand instances that you can shut down at any time. If you’re just getting started and won’t have any scalable environment then you’ll find that there’s very little difference in the cost.</p>
	<p>7. Beta and Bugs:<br>
	Google cloud still has some of its services still in beta version, which means that these services are still under testing and might be buggy, and they are. Mid 2016 I had a couple of instances on google cloud and a registered domain that drives traffic to one of these instances, one day I receive an alert from the budget control system in Google Cloud saying that I have past my limit of $100 per month, when i logged in I found out that I owe $154 overnight and the reason was the traffic coming through the domain name, not being a subscriber to any support plan, i didn’t have a number to call so i sent an email and a few hours later i received an email from Google Cloud’s support saying that this was caused by a bug in their system and they are working on fixing it. That was the deal breaker for me. So far, I haven’t faced a similar issue with AWS.</p>
	<p>8. Coverage:<br>
	AWS has 13 regions but not every region covers all of the services AWS offers such as CodePipeLine (code deployment service) which is only covered in parts of the states. Google cloud has 8 regions, 6 of which are in the states and one in Europe and one in east Asia.<br>
	I have to note out though, that id you’re just getting started and want to spend as little as possible, the regions in the stages have the cheapest resources for both platforms.</p>
	<p>9. Popularity:<br>
	If you want to eventually work as a devops then you need to search for jobs around you that require AWS and jobs that require Google Cloud.<br>
	Not surprisingly you will probably find that AWS experience is more demanded that GC.</p>
	<p>Those 8 points were my two cents to help me decide which platform i want to learn first which ended up being AWS. If you want to go deeper and see more comparisons here are some helpful links:<br>
