									<p class="">"Nick and I started discussing him making the Android version for me back in January and from the very beginning I knew he knew his stuff and was someone I felt confident would represent my business in the best possible light. I think as small business owners when we engage another business to do something for us, them actually doing the job is only part of the overall experience- how they go about their work, their values and morals and how professional they are throughout the relationship is just as important, at least it is for me anyway. Nick ticked every single one of these boxes and it got to a stage where he was more annoyed at the thought of him missing deadlines than I was. I was continually kept updated and his attention to detail was incredible- he refused to proceed with something unless it was perfect. If you need a website or app built to an extremely high standard by an ultimate professional, then Nick is your man. Highly recommended- thanks again mate."</p>

					<h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle-o"></i> How much does it cost to make an app</h4>
					<p>Our prices start at $2000 for a proof of concept app, however, there are a lot of factors that go into pricing an app, the best way to know how much your app would cost is by <a href="#!/contact">contacting us</a> directly and get an accurate estimate.</p>

					<h4><i class="fa fa-question-circle-o"></i> What is the process of making an app with you guys</h4>
					<ul>
						<li> Step 1 is having a chat over the phone to understand what you're after.</li>
						<li> Step 2 is creating specs document or a basic mockup that summarises the application and what it does and how it does it</li>
						<li> Step 3 is making an estimate of how much the app would cost and how long would it take to build. That estimate defines approximately how much the app would cost but does not provide an exact number</li>
						<li> Step 4 is providing a detailed mockup with the design that covers the all of the application's functionality and clearly explains what the end result would look like. We take a downpayment between $200 - $500 to cover the cost of this design.</li>
						<li> Step 5 is creating an accurate quotation that covers the exact cost (that would be around the estimate of step 3) and providing a delivery plan with dates </li>
						<li> Step 6 is developing the application</li> 
					</ul>
					<p>
						After the app is finished, we provide ongoing support and answer any questions you have about the application. If your application needs web hosting we provide a managed Amazon Web Serviecs hosting that covers all of your server needs.
