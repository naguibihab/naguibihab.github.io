Taking a punch to the face hurts, but it also makes you stronger.</span></p>

If I'm afraid I'll fail; it's as simple as that, and it goes for every aspect of our lives.</span></p>
<h4 style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 14pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #666666; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">If you're afraid to fail at work you'll never succeed, if you're afraid to make mistakes, you'll always be limited.</span></strong></h4>

In a way our nature is against us, it won't let us go outside that safe zone, it won't let us quit the jobs we hate because you might not find another, it won't let us propose to that girl because she might say no, it won't let us dare to take risks because we might fail and end up losing it all. Does that sound familiar dear reader? Let it sync in and think of when was the last time you hesitated and didn't aim higher than what you know you can achieve.</span></p>

I've learned to swallow it in and let critics teach me how to be better and let them build me but I'll always hate criticism. Before I learned that, I always avoided doing mistakes, I avoided giving promises I am not absolutely sure that I can deliver, I avoided trying out new technology, I avoided doing anything that has risk so that I would never fail. That's a myth, we always fail...</span></p>

What happens then?</span></h2>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A couple of days ago I walked up to a stranger in a pub and I played a joke on him, if you have met me before you'd already know that I'm not the type of person who would do such a thing, frankly because I don't know what the outcome is, that guy can turn around and tell me to f**k off, why would I risk getting told to f**k off?</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

Rather than asking yourself that, ask yourself "what's the best that can happen?"</span></p>

Would this actually happen? Not likely but imagining that that's their response will give you the boost of confidence you need to neglect any other possible outcome and focus on what you want to gain most.</span></p>
