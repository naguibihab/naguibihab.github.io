					<p>I have been a software developer for over six years, and during that time I have work for/with/along-side multiple startups, I got to experience the startup world time and time again, from getting an idea off a piece of paper and making it into a revenue-generating or time-saving application. I got to see many fail and fall and few get funded or make enough revenue to be reckongised in the market.</p>
					<p>I often speak about how tech startups work, and <strong>how to get an idea off the ground with little resources</strong>. When I started my business I promised myself that it would be a self-funded business and indeed it was, all the money I spent on marketing or salaries came from the business.<br>
						<span class="alternative-font">If you're limited on resources, you either become <strong>resourcefull</strong> or <strong>fail</strong></span></p>
					<p>I also like to speak about <strong>outsourcing</strong>, and how that is a sword with two edges, if you don't know what you're doing then you're set up to fail from the start, but if you do then you're able to have a strong smart remote team that would cost less than half of what a standard software company would charge (based on an personal <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/collectmore-case-study-successful-app-didnt-cost-arm-build-ihab/" target="_blank"> case study</a>)</p>
					<p>One of the subjects I find interesting is the emotional aspect of creating a startup, one particular emotion that most entrepreneurs have is a <strong>fear of failure</strong> which ironically ends up being the reason for failing. Creating a startup is an extremely emotional rollercoster, and if the founders are not equipped properly then the startup will not survive</p>
