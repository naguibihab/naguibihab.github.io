<p>“But We have always done it that way” The story about railroads gaugeFor an alarming number of times, I have seen the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">fear of change</strong> in different software companies and resistance to adopting new technology, and the excuse would often be:</p>
<article class="h-entry">

<div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
<p id="7469" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">“But we’ve always done it that way and it worked, why would we change it now?” to which I find no better response than referring them to the origins of the width of the railroad gauge, here’s the story:</p>

<p id="2d6b" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">The Stephenson gauge, also called the international or uniform gauge is 1435 millimetres and that’s used for most railroads around the world including Australia (Distance between the railroad tracks)</p>
<p id="b313" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why was that gauge used in Australia?</p>
<p id="d9e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because that’s the way they built them in England</p>
<p id="1621" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why did the English use that gauge?</p>
<p id="9231" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because the people who built the railroads used<br />
the same equipment and tools that they used for building<br />
waggons, which measured that wheel spacing.</p>
<p id="28fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Okay! Why did the waggons have that particular<br />
odd wheel spacing?</p>
<p id="dd93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, if they tried to use any other spacing,<br />
the waggon wheels would break on some of the old,<br />
long distance roads in England, because that’s<br />
the spacing of the wheel ruts.</p>
<p id="ccff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So who built those old rutted roads?</p>
<p id="371b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imperial Rome built the first long distance<br />
roads in Europe (and England) for their legions. The<br />
roads have been used ever since.</p>
<p id="6d5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And the ruts in the roads?</p>
<p id="6e2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts,<br />
which everyone else had to match for fear of<br />
destroying their waggon wheels.<br />
Since the chariots were made for Imperial Rome, they<br />
were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing.</p>
<p id="e68e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The uniform railroad gauge of 1435 mm is derived from the original<br />
specifications for an Imperial Roman war chariot<br />
because the Imperial Roman war chariots were made<br />
just wide enough to accommodate the back ends of two<br />
war horses (Yes, horse’s asses).</p>
<p id="7bf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And here’s an interesting story:</p>
<p id="bad0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we see a Space Shuttle sitting on the launch pad, there are two big booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These are the solid rocket boosters or SRBs. Thiokol makes the SRBs at a factory in Utah. The engineers who designed the SRBs might have preferred to make them a bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by train from the factory to the launch site.</p>
<p id="c197" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The railroad from the factory runs through a tunnel in the mountains. The SRBs had to fit through that tunnel. The tunnel is slightly wider than a railroad track, and the railroad track is about as wide as two horses’ behinds.</p>
<p id="e6d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So a major design feature of what is arguably the world’s most advanced transportation system was originally determined by the width of a horse’s ass!</p>
