<h4>Git repo: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/naguibihab/js-goodies">https://github.com/naguibihab/js-goodies</a></h4>
<h1>js-goodies</h1>
<p>Pure Javascript goodies without using any libraries.</p>
<h3>Why did I create this?</h3>
<p>Since I started working with different javascript frameworks I became more reliant on them and less on javascript to the extent that during a hackathon I realised "Oh Sh<em>t I don't know how to do an asyncronus http request in javascript" and I had to download JQuery *embarrassing moments</em>.</p>
<p>This repo will contain all the "tough" tricks that most people don't realise cane be done in javascript.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>First run <code>npm install lite-server -g</code> to install lite-server and use it</p>
