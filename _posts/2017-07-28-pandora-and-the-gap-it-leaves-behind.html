<p id="4c4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">For those of you who don’t know what Pandora is, it’s an online radio application that chooses music for you based on what you like and dislike, it’s not like itunes or spotify where you can choose what to listen to instead it will play different songs based on machine learning and AI, some you may have heard before and some you haven’t, an excellent tool to discover new music and artists.</p>
<p id="fa60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pandora launched in January 2000 in the states, and came to Australia twelve years later in 2012 and now five years later they are closing their Australian base, It is the third platform to cease local operations here in the past year, with Guvera and Deezer also closing their Australian bases.</p>
<p id="9e92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s no clear reason as to why they are shutting down however, that leaves an interesting gap in the market, Pandora’s audience will be looking for an alternative, and entrepreneurs in the music industry will be looking to fill that gap and gain that audience.</p>
