Based on the amount of debt, the time it remains outstanding, what the client has told you and other information, the app would use internal logic to identify which advice suits you best. <br> In addition to that the app also gives you SMS and Email templates that you can use to contact your client and it even <b>recommends</b> one for each of your unique debts.</p>

					<p class="mt-none mb-xlg fz-18 ng-binding" ng-bind-html="::proj.story | trustfilter">I first metup with Paul after he had created his ios version of the app but the company that he was with was overcharging him and delivering a poor quality code. <br> I did the initial android version for Paul and after a few months I did the second version for both the Android and the IOS apps. Paul's app is now one of the top 50 downloaded business apps in Australia</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p class="ng-binding">Nick and I started discussing him making the Android version for me back in January and from the very beginning I knew he knew his stuff and was someone I felt confident would represent my business in the best possible light. I think as small business owners when we engage another business to do something for us, them actually doing the job is only part of the overall experience- how they go about their work, their values and morals and how professional they are throughout the relationship is just as important, at least it is for me anyway. Nick ticked every single one of these boxes and it got to a stage where he was more annoyed at the thought of him missing deadlines than I was. I was continually kept updated and his attention to detail was incredible- he refused to proceed with something unless it was perfect. If you need a website or app built to an extremely high standard by an ultimate professional, then Nick is your man. Highly recommended- thanks again mate.</p>
