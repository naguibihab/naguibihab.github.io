					<h5 class="mb-xs heading-primary"><b>About The App</b></h5>
					<p class="mt-none mb-xlg fz-18">Peter Honey found a gap in the plumbing industry, it was nearly impossible for the plumber to get the best price out of the quotes received from the suppliers, thus came Gimble.<br> Gimble is a PHP web application that also communicates with <b>Android</b> and <b>IPhone</b> mobile applications. Its primary feature is to act as a <b>bidding system</b> for the suppliers to make bids on the request made by the plumber but it also works from the plumber's side only where the plumber can upload PDFs received from suppliers to be translated by the system as if the supplier had entered it in directly. <br> The mobile application also allows the user to search for the <b>nearest suppliers</b> based on the user's location.</p>

					<h5 class="mb-xs heading-primary"><b>The Story</b></h5>
					<p class="mt-none mb-xlg fz-18">Peter Honey found me through word of mouth. Peter had an idea for an app and didn't know where to go to get it done. His marketing expert, having worked with me before to solve different technical issues, recommended me to Peter and the relationship kicked off at that point. <br> Since 2014 I have done four different SaaS apps for Peter that has <strong>saved his business an incredible amount of hours and effort</strong> for what used to be routine work</p>

					<h5 class="mb-xs heading-primary"><b>The Techy Bit</b></h5>
					<p>The concept of the application itself is quite simple, two user types one creates requests and the other actions on them but the tricky bit was parsing the PDF, having multiple names for the same tool, understanding measurements and parsing them to a unified unit</p>
